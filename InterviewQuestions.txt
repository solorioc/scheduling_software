What You Are Doing Now

What kind of system is there in place currently to keep track of and manage volunteers and schedules?
How many volunteers are there? Do we have any idea of any increase/decrease in the number of volunteers in the near future?
How many people volunteer regularly? Do you have a system which tracks who shows up?
What is the primary form of communication with the volunteers? How do you contact volunteers if you need volunteers urgently?
Are people allowed to do partial shifts?
Have you tried other scheduling softwares before?
How do you keep track of the information on your volunteers?

What Do You Want the System to Do
Who is the user for the software?
Would you want volunteers to be able to change any part of the schedule (canceling appointments, changing appointments, etc. )?
Do you want remote access?
Do they want this on the web? (The existing website is a free hosting site)
Ask about the nature of the system (automatic vs manual)
Do you need a database of profiles for volunteers?
What important information about the volunteers do you want on it? (phone #, address, email,...)
Peopleâ€™s credentials and to what extent they matter in scheduling (i.e. CPR, first-aid, distance from shelter)
What should the user interface look like?
If we think there is existing software that could do part of this job, do you have any budgetary restrictions for that situation?

What Can We Do to Help
How often do you want to be in contact throughout this process? What is the best way of doing this (in person, over the phone, via email, snapchat, etc.)
How would we be able to volunteer at the shelter?
